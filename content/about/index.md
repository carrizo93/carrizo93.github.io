## Hello! My name is Nathan Kong.

I'm a 1A Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I plan on discovering my passions at Waterloo, jumping into exciting opportunites with an open mind and a desire to learn.

In my free time, I... listen to music. Big shocker, I know. But while I listen to music, I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I've built & modded my two keyboards (newest pictured below), nearly bricked myself out of my computer, and cook meals for myself daily, all with my favourite tunes blasting in my ears.

Want to get my opinion on an album? Question about my keyboard? Please feel free to reach out about anything!
