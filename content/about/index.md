## Hello! My name is Nathan Kong.

I'm a second-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, who is currently delving into advanced concepts and techniques in PCB design. 

I just wrapped up my internship in Singapore for the space startup [GALAMAD AEROSPACE](https://galamad.space/), where I am helping design and prototype space electronics. My work has included the design of a low-cost coarse sun sensor module, the redesign of a fine sun sensor module, and the installation of PCB manufacturing capabilities in our office. I have taken the next step in my electronics design career through GALAMAD, and I aspire to keep progressing forward.

Since joining [Electrium Mobility](https://electriummobility.com/) when I arrived in Waterloo, I've participated in PCB design for our electrical projects, such as the e-scooter, carber fibre skateboard, and custom electronic speed controller. Over my first work-term at [Hatch](https://www.hatch.com/), I worked under the [Nuclear business unit](https://www.hatch.com/en/Expertise/Energy/NuclearPower). From the handling and storage of aging nuclear waste systems, to impacting First Nations engineering capacity development in Atlantic Canada, I absorbed project managment skills and the world of consulting + the energy sector.

In my free time, I love listening to music. Name an artist or genre, and I've probably listened to them. My main genres are EDM, hip-hop, and kpop. I also design keyboards: I'm in the middle of designing my first fullsize keyboard, the [sg75](https://github.com/carrizo93/sg75). Lastly, I play collegiate League of Legends for Waterloo, objectively(!) make good food, and collect stickers.
