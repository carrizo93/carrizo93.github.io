## Hello! My name is Nathan Kong.

I'm a first-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, heading into my first co-op at Hatch, as a Power Co-op. Over my first term, I put my foot into the door of engineering, and look forward to continue doing so with Hatch.

In my free time, I... listen to music. Big shocker, I know. But while I listen to music, I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I've built & modded my two keyboards (newest pictured below), nearly bricked myself out of my computer, and cook my specialty dishes, all with my favourite tunes blasting in my ears.

Want to get my opinion on an album? Question about my keyboard? Please feel free to reach out about anything!
