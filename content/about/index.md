## Hello! My name is Nathan Kong.

I'm a first-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, who is curious about the world of PCB/hardware design.

Since joining Electrium Mobility when I arrived in Waterloo, I've designed a wide variety of PCBs, then soldered these PCBs into fully functional components we use in our e-vehicles. Over the Spring 2024 term, I will assemble the electrical components for our carbon fibre skateboard, while beginning the design of a custom electronic speed controller. I look forward to further devloping my hardware and electrical skills.

Over my first work-term at Hatch as a Power Co-op under the Nuclear business unit, I contributed to a numerous amount of unique projects. From the handling and storage of aging nuclear waste systems, to impacting First Nations engineering capacity development in Atlantic Canada, I absorbed the inner workings of engineering consulting and project management.

In my free time, I... listen to music. Big shocker, I know. But while I listen to music, I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty. I've built & modded my two keyboards (newest pictured below), and am currently in the process of designing a macropad for the Kailh Big Switch using my PCB design skills. Lastly, I play collegiate League of Legends for Waterloo, objectively(!) make good food, and collect stickers.

Want to get my opinion on an album? Question about my keyboard? Please feel free to reach out about anything!
