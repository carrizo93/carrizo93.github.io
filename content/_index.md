summary: "Welcome to Nathan Kong's music blog!"

After listening to music (maybe a little too seriously) for 3 years, I've formed thoughts and opinions that I feel ready to share with the world. So, I created this blog to dump those thoughts and opinions somewhere. 

Aside from listening to music, I build keyboards, collect stickers, and love cooking. Learn more about me below!
