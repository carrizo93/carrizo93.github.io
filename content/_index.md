summary: "Welcome to Nathan Kong's music blog!"

After listening to music (maybe a little too seriously) for 5 years, I've formed thoughts and opinions that I feel ready to share with the world. So, I created this blog to dump those thoughts and opinions somewhere.

Aside from listening to music, I design keyboards, play collegiate e-sports, and love cooking. Learn more about me below!
