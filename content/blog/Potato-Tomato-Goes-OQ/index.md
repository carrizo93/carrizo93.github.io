Following my previous year's collegiate e-sports escapades, I didn't think I'd be participating in any more competitive League of Legends for a while. That was, until a little "sock" came along and convinced myself + our group of (woefully underskilled) friends to sign up for a tournament; with the chance to directly qualify into the professional Tier 2 league. After all, did we have anything to lose?


## Context 

To help explain the North American pro scene, let's use the NHL (or any other professional sports league) to compare. The best players in North America compete in the LTA North (NHL), which is a league of 8 teams that fight for the top spots to play in international tournaments (Stanley Cup Playoffs). The tier 2 league is called the North American Challengers League (AHL), abbreviated NACL. These teams consist of developing talent, fringe players, and aging vets. There are typically 10 teams per season, but this year there are 7 with 3 open slots. To field rosters into these 3 slots, Riot (Gary Bettman) decided to hold a 64-seed tournament to find the top 3 teams; this tournament is the Open Qualifers (OQ).

There is a minimum skill requirement for these types of tournaments. Since individually evaluating upwards of 64 * 5 = 320 players would take an incredibly long time, the minimum skill requirement is usually determined through your "soloq" ladder rank (climb the ladder by winning games). Now typically, the minimum rank is Diamond 1 (top ~1% of players, 1 million players total). For OQ though, this rank requirement was removed. Which meant that anyone could sign up, regardless of rank. 

Of course, any sane person knows this is a serious tournament for serious players. After all, a spot to play in NACL is on the line.
