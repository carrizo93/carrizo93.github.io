2018 holds a special place in my heart because it was the year where my good friend introduced me to rap. As a young impressionable 13 year old, this defined my musical taste for about 5 years. Now that I'm older, and can properly reflect on those times, I really do think that 2018 was objectively the greatest year for rap. I'll take a look at the albums and tracks that defined the year, and how they hold up now that I'm out of my rap phase.

# Albums

## DAYTONA, ye, KIDS SEE GHOSTS - Kanye West, Pusha T

Colloquially known as the Wyoming Sessions to fans, this three album run made by Kanye over the summer may be the greatest three album run of all time. We begin with DAYTONA; Pusha T's album with Kanye on production. With Pusha absolutely at the top of his game and Kanye 

Movin


## ASTROWORLD - Travis Scott

BUTTERFLY EFFECT was the song my friend told me to listen to that started it all. Add on SICKO MODE, and those two tracks were really the only ones I knew back then. Fast forward a few years, I discovered the remaining 15 tracks of excellence from Travis. Although I prefer Rodeo over ASTROWORLD, SICKO MODE itself really defined Travis as a superstar in my mind back then. 

## Die Lit - Playboi Carti

## i am > i was - 21 Savage

## NOT ALL HEROES WEAR CAPES - Metro Boomin

## Swimming - Mac Miller

## Veteran - JPEGMAFIA

## Scorpion - Drake

In retrospect, this album is some hot garbage. But in the moment, Drake had some serious bangers. He had us in a chokehold with radio sensations such as God's Plan, feeling tough with cuts such as Mob Ties, and filming dance challenges with In My Feelings. Times were simpler back then.

## KOD - J. Cole

## TESTING - A$AP Rocky

## Some Rap Songs - Earl Sweatshirt

A shout to Earl for this one, definitely a very experimental album compared to the others on the list but still amazing. 

## ONEPOINTFIVE - Amine

Another shout to Amine for this album, which may not be my favourite but I still enjoyed. 

## CRY FOR ME - Saba

The only song that I really listened to was PROM/KING; an excellent storytelling track. Besides that, the album was quite nice.
