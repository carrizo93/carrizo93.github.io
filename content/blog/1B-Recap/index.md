In [true probablyalex fashion](https://probablyalexzhu.github.io/blog/2a-random-updates/), it's been a while since my last blog, and I've got some time to kill at an airport (I finished this two weeks later). So here's a quick update on what's going on in my life.  

![Post 1B photo](pac.jpg "I didn't get an aftermath photo after the last exam, but this picture of PAC was from the same day. The last exam was in STC. Cover photo is ECE '28 S4's group photo for 1B.")

## ~~Cali~~ Singapore or bust
You might be wondering why I'm at an airport 5 days before co-op starts; that's becuase I'm travelling to Singapore for my second co-op! I landed a position at [GALAMAD Aerospace](https://galamad.space/), a Singaporean space startup focusing on the development of a 16u CubeSat platform. I'll be working as an electronics engineer, where I'll be designing PCBs, manufacturing them inhouse, and prototyping them. As I finish this blog, I am nearing the end of my second week, where I have already learned so much. I already love the team and really look forward to the months ahead.

## It only gets easier from here

When I asked every upper year / lurked discord servers for opinions, everyone said that 1B was *bad*.

This was very true.

The gap between 1A and 1B is big; while not impossible, it is hard. 5 full load courses + stupid econ is a legitmate challenge of time juggling. Rotating 8:30am labs, followed by classes from 12:30-6:20pm meant near 10 hour days on Tuesday to Thursday. Then you'd go home and complete whatever quiz (out of 3) was due that day/tomorrow. By the end of the week, you had no more energy to study (sorry MATH119 quiz). But we did basically have a 4-day weekend to compensate. Did I make full use of those 4 days? Of course not.

The lack of a reading week before midterms was seriously detrimental; you more or less only had the night before to study for each midterm. That alongside with some transition from my poor 1A studying habits is probably why I did so poorly on midterms. Finals season felt a little different this time around, it felt like I couldn't focus as hard as I did compared to 1A finals. But that might have to do with the fact that every 1B final felt like a matter of life or death. The entire cohort was genuinely concerned for the worst case scenario where we fail the term; thankfully I and many others will be progressing to 2A.

It only gets easier from here... right? (The same upper years have mixed opinions on 2A and 2B. So, we'll see.)

## Recent jammers

Once again, I found myself listening to more YouTube sets than songs during 1B finals. Here are all of them.

Honestly, I don't remember anything notable to timestamp. But this is a very nice set to listen to.

<br />
As I currently live my best life in Singapore, I certainly won't be slacking off all the time- I'm getting ready to cook up some keyboards. Wishing you a good co-op/study term that's just as enjoyable as mine.
