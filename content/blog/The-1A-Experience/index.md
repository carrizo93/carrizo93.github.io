1A is over. And it certainly wasn't exactly what I expected it to be.

Everyone knows the "Waterloo" stereotype. The one where you do nothing but go to class and study until 2am everyday. Having known a lot of friends who go to Waterloo, and knowing they were pretty smart, I assumed that I too would have to adjust my ways and adopt this grindset. 

As I settled in, figuring out my schedule, meeting new people in my program, and gauging the workload... I actually struggled with finding homework to do at the start of the term. My math courses (calculus and linear algebra) just had weekly practice sets that you could do over the weekend. Calculus and physics had online assignments you could do in 2 hours the day they were due. Physics didn't even have a recommended practice set for the tutorials; it was kinda just look over the lecture slides, and do the online assessment as practice for the quiz. The textbook did have a lot of questions you could do, I just never did them. With the other courses not really having any major work at the start of the term, I took my time to go out and explore what Waterloo had to offer.

As the term progresed, I found that the core courses (two maths, physics) maintained their rather minimal workload where as the other courses' workloads started to pick up. The first two coding projects were relatively easy and I finished them
