[{"content":"Hello! My name is Nathan Kong. # I\u0026rsquo;m a first-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, who is curious about the world of PCB/hardware design.\nSince joining Electrium Mobility when I arrived in Waterloo, I\u0026rsquo;ve designed a wide variety of PCBs, then soldered these PCBs into fully functional components we use in our e-vehicles. Over the Spring 2024 term, I will assemble the electrical components for our carbon fibre skateboard, while beginning the design of a custom electronic speed controller. I look forward to further devloping my hardware and electrical skills.\nOver my first work-term at Hatch as a Power Co-op under the Nuclear business unit, I contributed to a numerous amount of unique projects. From the handling and storage of aging nuclear waste systems, to impacting First Nations engineering capacity development in Atlantic Canada, I absorbed the inner workings of engineering consulting and project management.\nIn my free time, I\u0026hellip; listen to music. Big shocker, I know. But while I listen to music, I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid to get my hands dirty. I\u0026rsquo;ve built \u0026amp; modded my two keyboards (newest pictured below), and am currently in the process of designing a macropad for the Kailh Big Switch using my PCB design skills. Lastly, I play collegiate League of Legends for Waterloo, objectively(!) make good food, and collect stickers.\nJRIS65, GMK Bento, Gateron CJ Blue Linear Switches (lubed + filmed), TX 1.2mm Stabilizers Want to get my opinion on an album?

For some god forsaken reason, he was posting on his Instagram story while we were waiting. We really need to give DJ Chase B his flowers for his phenomenal DJ and hypeman work for Travis. Chase B stalled for Travis while we were waiting for him to get on stage; he played some tracks to get the crowd fired up. Stage design was nice. Jumbotron graphics were also nice. I saved myself from more permanent ear damage with earplugs. It brought down the audio level from \u0026ldquo;ear-shattering loud\u0026rdquo; to just \u0026ldquo;loud\u0026rdquo;. A must-have for future concerts. However, I took the earplugs out for the main events: MELTDOWN and FEIN. Minor ear damage is acceptable for those songs. He played FEIN 5 times. I thought he would play it 8 times. Nightcrawler was played. Not until the main chorus unfortunately, but the beginning of the song was more than enough. My favourite song of the night. Wishing that beibs in the trap was played, with a NAV appearance. Or maybe Drake pulling up. Neither happened. And it should have happened, because Travis brought out Kanye at the Orlando concert. I splurged on a tour t-shirt. Reason: \u0026ldquo;No regrets + I can make back the money on co-op\u0026rdquo; (I did). Voice was only dead for one day. The plastic bottles weren\u0026rsquo;t turned away by security this time, and I definitely drank a fair share of water. I think I raged pretty hard; will not forget the feeling of going absolutely crazy to Travis\u0026rsquo; greatest songs. Shoutout to my brother for getting me the tickets for Christmas.\nNightcrawler, featuring my screams.

And it certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly what I expected it to be.\nThe scene after the physics final, which was the last final. Cover photo is ECE \u0026lsquo;28 taking a group photo after the exam. Welcome to engineering # Everyone knows the \u0026ldquo;Waterloo\u0026rdquo; stereotype. The one where you have classes from 8:30am to 5:30pm and study until 2am everyday. Knowing a lot of friends who go to Waterloo, and knowing they were pretty smart, I assumed that I too would have to adjust my ways and adopt this grindset.\nOrientation ended with every first-year getting a hard hat. As I settled in, figuring out my schedule, meeting new people in my program, and gauging the workload\u0026hellip; I actually struggled with finding homework to do at the start of the term. My math courses (calculus and linear algebra) just had weekly practice sets that you could do over the weekend. Calculus and physics had online assignments you could do in 2 hours the day they were due. Physics didn\u0026rsquo;t even have a recommended practice set for the tutorials; it was kinda just look over the lecture slides, and do the online assessment as practice for the quiz.\nAs the term progresed, I found that the core courses (two maths, physics) maintained their rather minimal workload where as the other courses\u0026rsquo; workloads started to pick up. The first two coding projects were relatively easy and I finished them well ahead of time. Our open design course started up, where we had to make a project with an STM32 microcontroller board from scratch. Our communications class started giving out writing assignments. I had to apply to a lot of co-op positions. Needless to say, the work was starting to pile up. But I managed to get by without really changing my working habits.\nThe first victim of the \u0026lsquo;caught sleeping\u0026rsquo; pictures. Then comes reading week, our week off before midterms. I brought home a classmate from BC so that he didn\u0026rsquo;t have to stay in Waterloo. I showed him around York Region, and we tried to do some studying for midterms together, which didn\u0026rsquo;t exactly pan out. He decided to go back to Waterloo, quoting \u0026ldquo;it was too much like home\u0026rdquo;, which made it hard to do work.\nMaybe he was right, because my midterm results were definitely subpar. I remember having a good laugh at my calculus midterm mark, knowing that it was my customary \u0026ldquo;Welcome to Waterloo Engineering\u0026rdquo; moment. But hey, at least I passed.\nThe grade distribution for the final question of the calculus midterm. It was a hard question. This was when I decided to make a shift towards that aforementioned stereotype, working harder than before the midterm. The content was getting harder too; linear algebra got a lot more abstract, we started integral calculus, and coding was moving on from the basics. I feel like the second half of the term passed a lot faster than the first half. That might be because I figured out a set weekly routine.\nTwo weeks before finals is when I seriously locked in. I separated days into two shifts: the afternoon shift was from 1pm till when I wanted dinner (usually 5 or 6pm), and the evening shift was from around 8pm to 1am. I basically did this everyday for 2-3 weeks, and stopped after my calculus final. Although I had one more final to go (physics), I was really burnt out. I also calculated that I had already passed the course without the final, but I like to think I would\u0026rsquo;ve studied if I didn\u0026rsquo;t know I already passed.\nWhat four days of non-stop calculus does to a man. Doodle by Samantha Lee I thought that every exam was pretty fair\u0026hellip; but one. The CS final was 14 questions, each requiring fully fleshed out hand-written code solutions, all in under 2.5 hours. It was the only exam where people were definitely looking around at their peers in disbelief once we finished. We definitely receieved some department-wide curve, because there was no way I got a mid-70 on that exam after writing at least three solutions in quickly scribbled psuedocode.\nI ended the term just shy of my target term average, which kinda sucked but was still good. I did much better this time around than midterms, was surprised at my better than expected calculus final, and will be baffled for at least months at how bad I did on my physics final (who saw this coming).\nOverall, 1A had its challenges; but they weren\u0026rsquo;t impossible. The Waterloo stereotype is true if you want to aim really high this term. But I managed to do just fine without the stereotype. I suspect I will have to lock in from the beginning of 1B, where everything is new content. But thats a problem after co-op.\nUW carrizo hits the rift # I was always aware of collegiate League of Legends. One of my elementary school friends had her brother play as the starting mid for UofT some years ago. But when I saw the postings for Waterloo Esports League tryouts, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think all too much about it. The tier average for the second team was around Masters, I never grinded ranked (still am plat), and being in Engineering surely meant I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time for this. As well, the only 5v5 competitive experience I had was consistently playing Clash for 3 years.\nClash is an informal monthly tournament hosted by Riot Games in the game client. Prizes are in-game skins. Pictured are the trophies I\u0026rsquo;ve accumulated for winning. About a week before tryouts, my friend who I played with often and was also at Waterloo begged me to tryout, saying that he would only tryout if I did as well. The only thing holding me back was the $10 tryout fee, which I was really not trying to pay. To the rescue are some silly Americans that love ARAM who PayPaled me the $10. And so, I was signed up.\nOn the day of the tryout, I was all wired up and ready to go; only to find out that I would be playing in 1 game out of 3. And my opponent would be some random guy stuck in Silver. At this point, I thought it would be over for me; I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a shot to prove my skill against a higher-ranked player. I waited the two hours by watching the other games, and won my game convincingly.\nFor reference, these are the ranks in League. Platinum (me) is about top 25% of players, and Masters (tier 2 competitive average) is top 0.7%, all in the respective region. North America has about 1.6 million players in the ranked ladder. But I might\u0026rsquo;ve won a little too hard. Hard enough where after my game, the coaches messaged me to join a private call (which I didn\u0026rsquo;t see for at least 15 minutes). I played so well in my game where the coaches thought I was smurfing, given that I had never climbed past Gold in my op.gg. To this I told them that I just never played ranked because of how terrible soloq is to play, and that I played a lot of Clash for the past few years. They told me that I was onto the second round, as well as my friend whom I asked to play with in this round.\nIn this second round, I was matched up against a Masters tank player. First game we lost, I got countered. Second game I countered him, and managed to beat him by a decent margin. With this, I ended the tryouts on a lot of uncertainty. I only played 2 champs, I\u0026rsquo;m plat and he\u0026rsquo;s Master, how did the other players play (there were two games running concurrently), etc. Didn\u0026rsquo;t help that they delayed the decision. Two days later, while shopping at Costco, I got an Outlook notification.\nI made the team, along with my friend. He\u0026rsquo;s the jungler. Although I\u0026rsquo;m at the very bottom of the barrel (League Black is the developmental team to League Gold + I\u0026rsquo;m not the starter), I was still on the team. And that felt pretty cool.\nThroughout the term, I managed to play in a few scrims, and even played in a tournament match. Hell, I\u0026rsquo;ve managed to solokill Challenger players (take my word they are Challenger). And I\u0026rsquo;m part of the small minority of League players that have managed to make some money ($20) off the game. My teammates are amazing, my coach is super chill, and playing competitive League is just so much fun. It\u0026rsquo;s been an unexpected but wonderful experience so far, and I would love to continue playing collegiate e-sports throughout my undergrad.\nThe Waterloo Esports family for 2023-2024. Everything else # I joined Electrium Mobility, a personal electric vehicle focused design team. I was on the e-scooter team, where I (questionably) soldered parts together. Shoutout to Damir for leading our team, and Sherwin who oversaw the entire design team (and helping me with 150). I met up with some elementary school friends and watched a Kitchener Rangers pre-season game. Making the trip down to The Aud was surprisingly easy, and OHL hockey is still good hockey to watch. Minds were blown over how some of the players were 2007 born. Intramural hockey was fun. I quickly found out that the competitive division meant AA/AAA players, and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t played rep hockey in 5 years. I transferred to the semi-competitive division and found an old friend whom I walked to games with. Our team almost became intramural champions, but lost in the finals. The CMH front desk let us borrow those move-in carts so we didn\u0026rsquo;t have to carry our bags all the way to CIF. Cooking was pretty fun in my little kitchen. I can confidently say I only had two \u0026ldquo;struggle meals\u0026rdquo; throughout the entire term; and they were both because I had to clear out the fridge before leaving Waterloo. I joined DJ Club. I will never trash talk a DJ ever again. It is much, much harder than you think it is. I went to a couple Waterloo K-pop club events. They were great, and I even won a face mask for winning the \u0026ldquo;guess the dance\u0026rdquo; challenge. We are missing a keyboard club. I may or may not start one up in the future. A special shoutout to my calculus professor Serge D\u0026rsquo;Alessio, who truly was the GOAT. Our cohort managed to go out for a dinner with him, where we all took pictures with him. Below are some photos I collected over the term.\n1A was an appropriate introduction to university.

Naturally, I have to rank them all. I also threw in singles at the bottom, but only with my thoughts.\nI ranked them with a heavy emphasis on the title track, with added bonus points if the B-sides are good. Think 70/30 split on title track, bsides. Honorable mentions are songs that I think are worthy of a shoutout. A friendly reminder that this is just my opinion.\n1. Get Up EP, NewJeans # The first listen of the full EP was very rough for me. So rough where Get Up was the best new song for me. I didn\u0026rsquo;t touch the new songs for like 3 weeks. Then I got around to listening to the new songs again, adding them to my playlist. Over time, the songs got better for me, but I never thought that it could top Jihyo for release of the summer. Yet here we are; NewJeans takes the crown for song(s) of the summer with their typical bangers.\nHonorable mention: New Jeans\n2. Killin\u0026rsquo; Me Good - ZONE, Jihyo of TWICE # To be frank, this is just a really solid album. Good production, good vocals, good songs. I really don\u0026rsquo;t have anything else to say.\nHonorable mention: Closer, Wishing On You\n3. Party O\u0026rsquo; Clock - A Midsummer NMIXX\u0026rsquo;s Dream, NMIXX # RAHHHHHHHHHHHH NMIXX ARE SO BACKKKKKKKKKKK !!!!!!!!!!\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t feel expergo (their March release) all too well, so I was really hoping NMIXX could return to their past form of O.O and DICE with this release. And while it definitely isn\u0026rsquo;t on that level of O.O and DICE, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely a fun and amazing summer jam that has my head bopping.\nHonorable mention: Roller Coaster\n4. Bubble - TEENFRESH, STAYC # As much as I do love STAYC, the first listen of Bubble was actually pretty hard. Something about it didn\u0026rsquo;t match with the traditional STAYC sound I was used to. Or the MV was just really weird. That, along with Jihyo\u0026rsquo;s solo debut made me not touch Bubble and TEENFRESH as a whole for bit. But I get it now.\nHonorable mention: Be Mine\n5. Air Force One - Version Up, ODD EYE CIRCLE # Although I\u0026rsquo;m not the biggest LOONA stan (unlike some people I know), I was pretty happy to hear that LOONA beat their case and see them all redebut. Air Force One has convinced me to download all of LOONA\u0026rsquo;s + subunit discography (at some point in the future).\nHonorable mention: Je Ne Sais Quoi\n6. The Flash, KWON EUNBI # The winner of the IZ*ONE comebacks, Eunbi releases probably the most IZ*ONE coded song since their disbandment. And I feel like I can imagine all of IZ*ONE on this track. Really nice title track.\nNo honorable mention :(\n7. TAXI - LOVE ALL, JO YURI # I had actually never listened to Yuri\u0026rsquo;s solo work before this. Safe to say I listened to the rest of her discography after listening to this release. A cute title track backed by a solid roster of B-sides made LOVE ALL an enjoyable listen.\nHonorable mention: Lemon Black Tea\n8. Fast Forward - GAME PLAN, JEON SOMI # After beating the H\u0026amp;M mall music allegations, Fast Forward became a catchy hit with the dance to back it up. I really love the booming, reverberating bass/808s in the prechorus. Wishing the song was just a bit longer; but otherwise a very good title.\nHonorable mention: The Way\n9. Shhh - Self-titled, KISS OF LIFE # As the biggest group to debut this year (so far), it\u0026rsquo;s been really refreshing to see what KoL have pulled off with Shhh. Although some of the solo songs haven\u0026rsquo;t hit that well with me, I am very excited to see what they can do in the future.\nHonorable mention: Sugarcoat (Natty Solo)\n10. Girls\u0026rsquo; Capitalism - LOVElution, tripleS # I can\u0026rsquo;t lie; for a time I thought the title was just a Generation copy. But the song is pretty good for me now. The B-sides are where this album truly shines (which is ironic because I honestly can\u0026rsquo;t tell tripleS songs apart from one another).\nHonorable mention: Seoul Sonyo Sound, probably the best UK Garage song to be released during this trend\n11. CAKE - KILL MY DOUBT, ITZY # In a similar fashion to SNEAKERS, ITZY have released a song that is pretty good everywhere except the main chorus. And just like SNEAKERS, I grew to love the chorus for how silly it is. cakecakecakecakecake!!!!\nHonorable mention: Kill Shot, which is missing just a little something to be an incredible instrumental\n12. HATE RODRIGO - HATE XX, YENA # That whole Olivia Rodrigo fiasco was really unfortunate for Yena; hoping she\u0026rsquo;ll come back stronger and own that \u0026ldquo;shame of Korea\u0026rdquo; slander. The YUQI feature is pretty cool to see, especially when there are basically no collabs between artists.\nHonorable mention: WICKED LOVE\n13. SLAY - ALL MY GIRLS, EVERGLOW # The song is ok. It sounds like a Geometry Dash song that I would hear playing the game back in elementary school. At least they\u0026rsquo;re out of their dungeon.\nHonorable mention: Oh Ma Ma God\nSingles # An interesting array of singles from XG. NEW DANCE is by far my favourite, with it being a complete summer jam. If only it came out in July and not the second last week of August.\nJennifer (yuhhh) continues her streak of excellent solo work with something straight out of the opening scene of a 2000\u0026rsquo;s movie.\nSuper chill song with a sick guitar solo that I wish I could put the effort in to learn (the tab is also paywalled).\nYes, I know this is technically a mini album. I just didn\u0026rsquo;t listen to it. Nice song.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sorry but I do not like this song.

The first of many \u0026lsquo;where is Don Toliver ?\u0026rsquo; from Alex. SIRENS is a little silly. SIRENS is very silly. Drake. BNYX did an incredible job with the second beat. The tie fighter sample is hard. 3 beats, just like SICKO MODE. I did not believe it was Carti at the beginning of FE!N. It actually was not Carti. Mike Dean did not produce this beat. POV: you just walked into the Dracula final boss fight in Castlevania and FE!N starts playing. Like everyone else, we could not figure out who was on the second half of the song. We still couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure it out. Genius was wrong. Not pictured: DELRESTO (ECHOES). It was not very interesting.\nThe cleanest production on the album goes to I KNOW?. The relaxed, calm vibe of I KNOW? is suddenly cut by the brazen TOPIA TWINS. 21 Savage. TOPIA TWINS is suddenly cut off by Swae Lee. Me personally, I have never had my airpods go out of sync. Not pictured: PARASAIL. It was a nice interlude.\nWe place our bets on how many beat switches SKITZO will have. The first beat switch. I won the beat switch bet, with 3. Westside Gunn makes his appearance on the album, along with his classic adlibs. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why Alex typed LOONA. Made me think LOONA was on the track or something.

And honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t even blame him, because six months ago I would’ve answered the same.\nThe view from the 100-level before the concert. They were not my seats. Do I go to the concert… yes or yes # When I first saw the announcement for TWICE’s world tour that included a Toronto stop, I asked my friends if they wanted to go as a joke. I knew that it would be impossible to get tickets, and I really didn\u0026rsquo;t see myself as that big of a TWICE fan in the first place. I really only listened to their most popular title tracks. As well, I wanted my first concert to be for an artist that I really like and support. The only other two concerts I considered going to were JPEGMAFIA’s and Kendrick Lamar’s concerts in 2022 (I should’ve tanked the hefty price tag for Kendrick’s concert).\nSeeing “TWICE concert tickets for sale!” Instagram stories toyed with my mind, but I held back from sending a message to any sellers. But as the concert grew closer and closer, the thought of actually going to the concert also grew. Until I did send a message. Then a few more. Although these inquiries didn’t lead to anything, I subconsciously decided that I was going to find a ticket to this damned concert, even up until the day before the first show when most tickets were sold out for both days. I would be banking on last-minute sellers dropping their prices for a quick sale, a strategy that I had only heard of but had never participated in.\nSomething about being an Asian teen male going to a TWICE concert alone didn\u0026rsquo;t sit right in my head, so I needed a friend to help make it less awkward. One problem; my usual suspects were unavailable. I asked everyone I knew, even light K-pop listeners, but was met with unfortunate rejections. At this point, I was seriously contemplating posting an Instagram story begging someone to come with me, until another lone Asian teen male had posted an Instagram note pleading for tickets. Introducing Tyler; a Grade 11 from my school who I knew of, but probably didn\u0026rsquo;t know of me. A quick DM and we joined forces in our search. Most importantly, I had succeeded in my search for a friend to go with. (The first time Instagram notes have served a purpose!)\nFree-for-all deathmatch # An accurate depiction of what it was like trying to get tickets. As mentioned earlier, tickets were hard and scarce to find, especially with Tyler’s $200 budget to work with. Ticketmaster and resale sites had 300-level tickets at over $200 CAD; I knew that I could find a better deal. Taking the advice of a friend, I joined the fanmade TWICE Toronto Discord server, where other fans were selling their tickets. Here, I spent the next 36 hours watching the #tickets channel like a hawk. I used the first day of the concert as a gauge for Day 2 prices, where there were quite a few good deals. I was hoping those deals would also appear the next day. It didn’t help that there was another fan who was looking for the exact same thing as me- two tickets for $200 or less. Whatever [WTS] (want to sell) thread I was in, they were also in. Fist-fighting for tickets, one could say.\nAfter monitoring Day 1 ticket sales (at a family friend’s dinner), something clicked in my head that I had to get tickets that night, or else it would be too late. And it wasn’t even like there weren’t any tickets; Ticketmaster was selling 100-level seats for about $233 each, a pretty good deal for the section, albeit above our friend’s budget. Nevertheless, I got home at around 10pm and sat at my PC for the next 4 hours staring at the tickets thread. It reached a point where I was necroing month-old threads, dm-ing the OPs asking if they were still selling. (No one replied.) I was also really lowballing, asking $400 VIP w/ soundcheck ticket sellers if they could do $200. (No one replied.) But as the night wore on, fewer and fewer new threads and messages started to appear.\nThen, at midnight, I get a notification for a new thread.\n[WTS] selling 4 tickets for section 109, $300 negotiable!!!\nI knew that this could be the one. I immediately sent a message to the OP, initially offering $500 for the two tickets. I used the Ticketmaster tickets as leverage, saying I found “some tickets for lower than $500”, even though they weren’t as good (but the seller didn’t know that). I managed to haggle it down to $450 for the pair, and we agreed on the deal. I decided to let the seller figure out how to process the payment through PayPal, figuring it would take them a while as it took them a bit to reply to my messages in the first place. But 40 minutes is a really long time, so I sent them a message asking them if everything was all right.\nYou can imagine what was going through my head reading this. Was it messed up? Yes. Was I pissed off? Yes, and I had to express that in a way that was polite and did not involve expletives.\nYou can imagine what I wanted to say. Pretty good, if I say so myself.\nIt actually turned out that the seller’s friends were supposedly yelling at them, so I assumed they got peer-pressured into canceling the transaction. I let them go by letting them know it\u0026rsquo;s bad practice to do things like that and asked them to pass the message along to their friends.\nSo, now I’m back at square one. I’m pissed, it\u0026rsquo;s 2:15 in the morning, I need to sleep soon, and I have no tickets. What else can I do but wait?\nLess than 15 minutes later, another new thread notification popped up.\n[WTS] two tickets section 308 $150 each\nIt was like after all the trouble I went through, God himself has come down and given me a blessing. However, I was immediately skeptical because the post didn\u0026rsquo;t follow the mandatory post guidelines of including a watermarked screenshot, which was pretty clearly defined in the tickets channel. I sent a DM anyways, scam or not, asking for a screenshot of the tickets. The seller replied with watermarked screenshots of the tickets, which made me feel a little bit better. We agreed on $300 and worked on payment. For some reason, Ticketmaster decided to have a fit; the seller couldn’t transfer their tickets at that moment. So, we agreed to transfer them the next day, after I made the seller promise me they wouldn’t dupe me like the previous seller. (No way in hell I was doing that again.)\nI woke up in the morning, ate breakfast, stuffed everything I needed into my pockets, borrowed some portable chargers (that we didn’t even use [thanks Linxi]), bought some backup granola bars, picked up Tyler, and drove down to Finch station. Parking was free because of the Canada Day holiday. We hopped on Line 1 down to Union Station, seeing a few other ONCEs (the name for TWICE fans) headed down just like us. Getting off, I left my AirPods case on the subway by accident, which was unfortunate (manageable losses + I replaced them the day after). Undeterred, I completed the ticket transfer with our seller as we walked out of the station.\nAnd at long last, I had the tickets.\nGod gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. Like vultures circling their prey # We arrived at Scotiabank Arena around noon. One of the unintentional perks of joining the TWICE Toronto Discord was that we found out about freebies. Like any sane person, the only reason why we were there so early was for these freebies. So, for the next two hours, we hung around Maple Leaf Square, beelining towards even the smallest group of people surrounding someone. We also bumped into Mr. Li, who was in line for the merch. He bought a tour T-shirt.\nA teacher at my high school, Mr. Li, makes a surprise appearance. Used with permission. The time is now 2pm, with the concert starting at 7:30pm. Five hours passed in a mix of sitting in Union Station and charging our phones, eating food, and watching the random play dance that was being hosted. Even though we didn’t know half the songs (we’re 4th gen babies 😥), it was still enjoyable to watch Toronto’s K-pop community come out and show off their dance skills. My favourite was a performance of Nayeon’s POP! by two young performers.\nThere should have been a video here but your browser does not seem\rto support it.\rAt 6:30, we decided to head toward the gates to start lining up. To our surprise, Gate 1 (the main gate) had no lineup at all. Our lucky day we thought, until security took away our water bottles. We had been told that clear plastic water bottles were allowed, and they were; people who entered through other gates had brought theirs in. Thus began our wild goose chase for cups and a water fountain; we asked maybe 10 different food stands for cups, all of which said no. Thankfully, Guest Services bailed us out by getting us the cups that we were supposedly able to get at these food stands. (Inconsistency seemed to be the name of the game at Scotiabank Arena that night.)\nAfter collecting one last freebie, we made our way up to the 300 level for our seats. And although they weren’t the 100-level seats that we were initially promised, it was still pretty damn good for $150. We sat down and waited for what felt like the longest and shortest 30 minutes of my life. Sometimes the silence would be broken by a JYPNation video showcasing their groups. (I swear SKZ got the loudest cheer?)\nThe clock strikes 7:30. The visuals on the stage screens change. Music starts playing. A loud cheer erupts. It is happening.\nThe view from our seats in section 308. Ready to be # For the next 2 hours and 30 minutes, Mr. “I really didn\u0026rsquo;t see myself as that big of a TWICE fan” screams his lungs out to basically every song. And although I botched all the Korean pronunciations, you can bet I screamed every English lyric.\nI won’t talk about every song; you can find the setlist here. I’ll list out my highlights of the concert instead. (I would put concert clips in, but I need to protect my image\u0026hellip;)\nThe first TWICE release that I experienced was MOONLIGHT SUNRISE, their second English single. Given that it\u0026rsquo;s my second highest listened-to TWICE song (126 streams), I think I perfectly sang the entire song. We received a compliment from the fans beside us, saying our singing was “really good”. My throat started giving out 30 minutes in. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how the rest of the audience did it; I started clapping in lieu of screaming/cheering. But when I could scream, I screamed. Every few songs, there was a break to allow the group to rotate into their solo stages. During these breaks, I sprinted to refill our water cups. Probably the reason why my voice was only dead for a few days. God forbid why everyone started barking when Dahyun was on camera/speaking. Did I bark? Yes. I came back in time for the Mina and Momo solo stages. Need I say more? The live band sounded incredible, and their epic build-up to Feel Special was probably my favourite moment of the night. It was insane to me that their most popular songs were stitched together into a live medley. (YES or YES to Heart Shaker in the set list) Why did they start Likey at the rap??? The entire arena was ready for the chorus of the song 😭 Shoutout to the guy who started twerking when he was on camera for the dance battle. Celebrate # The concert ends.\nIt is over. The post-concert depression immediately hits like a truck. Looking around the now-illuminated arena, the only reaction I could conjure was “Damn.” I just watched one of the greatest (if not the greatest) K-pop girl group perform all of their hit songs in Canada, a country they had never toured before. And I knew every song, screaming whatever lyrics I could. That was my very first concert, my first “real” music experience, my first K-pop experience. And it was one that I will never forget.\nAs we start making our way back, I take note of all the ONCEs we pass by on our way to Union Station. We replay our concert clips on the subway, laughing at the audio of a few specific clips (Take a guess of which performances). We listen to the set one last time on the car ride, knowing that we’ll never scream the lyrics louder ever again. After dropping off Tyler, I arrive home at around 11pm, immediately rushing to hide my freebies from my parents. And thus comes to an end to probably the craziest 36 hours of my life.\nWould I do it again? Yes.\n","date":"14 August 2023","permalink":"/blog/how-i-went-to-twice-toronto-day-2/","section":"Blogs","summary":"A recap of the wild 36 hours I had leading up to the TWICE concert.","title":"How I went to TWICE Toronto Day 2"},{"content":"My tier list of K-pop girl group title tracks.
